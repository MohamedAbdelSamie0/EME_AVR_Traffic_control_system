# **DESCRIPTION:**
## *Basic traffic lights operation*
  Lights start off Green --> Yellow --> Red and then loop for cars
## *Interrupt algorithm:*
  when a pedestrian hits the button an interrupt is fired causing the car traffic lights to pause operation in case of green or yellow lights
  lights go straigh to yellow blinking for 5 seconds then both Red and Blue lights turn on for 5 seconds, meaning pedestrians can cross,
  while printing pedestrians on LCD.
  if button pressed while Red is on, nothing is changed.
